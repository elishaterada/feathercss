# FeatherCSS

FeatherCSS is a minimalist CSS starter that come with Dark Mode, RTL, and accessibility out of the box. It purposefully excludes features like grid layout, media queries, or icons which tends to require per-project customization.


## Key Highlights

- It’s Just CSS™ with CSS variables. Bring your own LESS/SaaS/CSS-in-JS solution
- Super minimal at only 2kb gzipped
- Learn just a few simple class names, the rest is default you can tweak around directly.

## How Dark Mode works

FeatherCSS ships with **Dark Mode** support out of the box with CSS variables. In order to provide maximum flexibility of turning it on, off, or automatically switch based on user display settings, you can toggle ```data-theme="dark"``` attribute to your markup with a minimal JavaScript code (consult your framework specific solutions).

## Browser Support

FeatherCSS supports all the latest browsers (or degrade gracefully), minus the IE11 which is being deprecated even from high-traffic websites like StackOverflow and LinkedIn.

## Quick Install

### Install with npm

```shell
npm install feathercss
```

### Install with Yarn

```shell
yarn add feathercss
```

## Import

Only ```variables.css``` file is required for all other CSS components to work. Otherwise, you can pick and choose which ones you want to import individually.

```javascript
import "feathercss";

/* or import them individually */
import "feathercss/dist/components/variables"; // Required
import "feathercss/dist/components/global"; // Required
import "feathercss/dist/components/typography";
//... and so forth
```
